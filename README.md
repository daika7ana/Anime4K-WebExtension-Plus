### I. First Run (Onboarding)

After installing the extension, an onboarding page will automatically open. For the best experience, please follow the guide to complete the setup:

1.  **GPU Benchmark**: The extension will run a short benchmark (Target: 1080p -> 4K 24fps) to evaluate your graphics card performance.
2.  **Recommended Tier**: Based on the results, the extension will automatically recommend a suitable Performance Tier:
    *   🚀 **Performance**: Best for integrated graphics or older devices, prioritizing smoothness.
    *   ⚖️ **Balanced**: Balances quality and performance, suitable for most mid-range devices.
    *   🎨 **Quality**: Provides better image detail, suitable for discrete graphics cards.
    *   🔬 **Ultra**: Maximum quality, requires strong graphics card performance.
3.  **Apply**: You can accept the recommendation or manually select another tier.

### II. Daily Use

1.  **Enable Enhancement**: Play a video on a supported website (e.g., Bilibili, YouTube). A purple **"✨ Enhance"** button will appear on the left side of the video player when you hover over it.
2.  **Click to Toggle**: Click the button to enable real-time super-resolution. The button state will change from "⏳ Starting..." to "❌ Cancel".
3.  **Auto-hide**: The button will automatically hide when the mouse is moved away to maintain a clean viewing experience.

### III. Popup Panel Settings

Click the Anime4K extension icon in the browser toolbar to open the quick settings panel:

*   **Performance Tier**: Quickly switch between four presets.
    *   *Note: When a "Custom Mode" is selected, the Performance Tier is unavailable because custom modes are defined by their specific shader combinations.*
*   **Enhancement Mode**:
    *   **Built-in Modes**: Classic Anime4K presets like Mode A, Mode B, Mode C.
    *   **Custom Modes**: Advanced modes created or imported by you.
*   **Resolution**: Set the target output resolution (x2 scaling or fixed 1080p/4K, etc.).
*   **Whitelist**:
    *   Quickly add the current page, domain, or parent path to the whitelist.
    *   Enable/disable the global whitelist feature.

### IV. Advanced Options

Click the **"Settings"** button at the bottom of the panel to access the detailed settings page:

#### 1. General Settings
*   **Appearance**: Switch between Light/Dark themes.
*   **Compatibility**: Enable **"Cross-Origin Compatibility Mode"** to fix videos that fail to enhance due to browser security policies (common with nested third-party players).

#### 2. Performance Settings
*   **GPU Benchmark**: Re-run the benchmark at any time to update your performance score.
*   **Current Tier**: View the currently active performance configuration.

#### 3. Enhancement Modes
*   **Visual Editor**: Create brand new custom modes.
*   **Drag & Drop Sorting**: Adjust the order of applied shaders or the mode list itself.
*   **Share Config**: Import/Export your custom mode configurations (JSON format).
